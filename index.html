                <h2>Why create software?</h2>
                <p>
                    I build software because I believe in people's ability to
                    use it as a tool to help plan, design, and create better
                    lives for people.
                </p>
                <h3><em>To increase quality of life for all.</em></h3>
                <p>
                    Or it's only to provide for me and my family and anything
                    else I tell myself is a coping mechanism for the suffering
                    incurred by the system we live in. There's probably some
                    truth to that.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I work as a senior software engineer for Autodesk in
                    Portland, Oregon. Before that, I worked as a software
                    engineer for Kaiser Permanente.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a few things that I consider my passions, though
                    my friends and family would tell you that I'm passionate
                    about everything. My penultimate desire is to create a
                    better world. Please, ask me about it. It is my belief that
                    to do so, we must intentionally plan, design, and make
                    spaces that are equitable for people of every background and
                    that provide means of living sustainably. I want to build
                    software that supports this effort, which is why I'm working
                    to attain a Graduate Certificate in Urban Design from
                    Portland State University. It's why I have spent many days
                    reading and attending lectures and workshops to hear from
                    both the dominant voices and those largely unheard.
